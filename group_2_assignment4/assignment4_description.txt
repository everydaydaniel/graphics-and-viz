This animation just illustrated an urban city.
The included classes are Car(), Sun(), and Cloud().
The car class instantiates car objects of differient
colors and speeds. The wheels also rotate at different
speeds. The sun class instantiates a sun object that
moves in the xy plane and also rotates. The cloud
class instantiates cloud object that move in the
xy plane and also rain at certain points. The color
of the clouds turn darker as they begin to rain.
We were initially going to do a bird class instead
of a sun class but decided there might not be enough
space in the sky for both multiple clouds and
multiple birds.
